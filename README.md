Qkrio allows you to set timers for multiple dishes you are currently cooking. Once the timer runs out, you will get a friendly notification that your dish is ready to be served.

Are you preparing a dish often and do not want to set timers every time from the start? Save the timer to favourites and next time start it easily. This way you will never forget how much time certain specialty needs. You can also save notes to a certain timer so you donâ€™t forget certain peculiarities.

Are your friends or family coming over for lunch and don't want to forget to start cooking in time? Set a reminder for when you want to start cooking and how much earlier you want to receive a notification. Also, you can set the time you want your dish to be cooked and Qkrio will notify you when you need to start cooking.
